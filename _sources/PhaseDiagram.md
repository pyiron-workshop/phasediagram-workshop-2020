# Phase Diagram
Based on the previous tutorials to calculate the free energy using the quasi-harmonic approximation, the phase diagram is calculated by constructing the convex hull of the mixing energies. The resulting phase diagram for the Howells Mishing Ni Cr Potential is plotted below in comparison to the experimental phase diagram.
