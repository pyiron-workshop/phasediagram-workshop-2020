The first interactive tutorial covers the basics of jupyter notebooks, the pyiron projects object, atomistic structures in pyiron, the atomistic neighbours class and the creation of special quasi random structures. The tutorial uses the mybinder cloud to execute jupyter notebooks directly in the web browser, therefore no installation is required to follow this tutorial.
