Series of interactive tutorials explaining how to calculate thermodynamic properties with atomistic simulation using pyiron, an integrated development environment for complex simulation protocols. Starting with a brief motivation followed by four interactive sessions using jupyter notebooks to demonstrate the use of pyiron. This video series was recorded as part of the first virtual workshop on: software tools from atomistics to phase diagrams.
