    "The Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) code is used inside pyiron for atomistic simualtion with interatomic potentials. These interatomic potentials approximate the interaction of atoms and can be either fitted to density functional theory (DFT) or experimental results. Still in contrast to density functional theory which scales cubically with the number of atoms interatomic potentials scale linearly with the number of atoms. Therefore we are going to use primarly interatomic potentials in this workshop but most calculations could be executed with a DFT codes as well. "
