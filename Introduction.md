Introduction to the tutorial series of calculating thermodynamic properties with atomistic simulation using pyiron, an integrated development environment for computational materials science. This video series was recorded as part of the first virtual workshop on: software tools from atomitics to phase diagrams. It covers the motivation to use atomistic simulations to calculate thermodynamic properties and it introduces pyiron as integrated development environment for computational materials science to address the technical complexity of thermodynamic simulation protocols.
